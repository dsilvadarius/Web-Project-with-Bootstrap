Web-Project-with-Bootstrap
==========================

A tutorial I'm taking from webdesigntutsplus.

The @import url(assets/css/bootstrap.css); rule is not getting imported or the 
<link type="text/css" href="/assets/css/styles.css"  rel="stylesheet"> is not getting connected to the 
styles.css. Any help is appreciated.
